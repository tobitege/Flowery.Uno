## ⛔ 3-Iteration Rule (No Silent Scope/Approach Changes)

**During multi-tool execution**: If an approach isn't working after 3 attempts, **ASK** before trying something different. Do NOT:

- Silently decide "this is too complex, let me rewrite/simplify it"
- Expand scope from a targeted fix to a multi-hundred-line refactor
- Switch fundamental approaches mid-execution without user awareness

The rule prevents the AI from *unilaterally* changing direction. Interactive discussion with the user is always fine.

**"Fix Root Cause" vs "Minimal Change"** — These are NOT contradictory:

- ✅ Fix root causes across multiple files if needed — just mention what you're doing
- ❌ Don't refactor unrelated code "while you're there"
- ⚠️ Pause and ask only for *significant* scope changes (10-line fix → 200-line rewrite, architecture changes)

## ⚠️ Git Bash CRLF Rule

When using `sed`, `cat`, `head`, `tail` on Windows files, **ALWAYS** pipe through `| tr -d '\r'`:

```bash
sed -n '100,110p' file.cs | tr -d '\r'
```

Otherwise output will be garbled due to CRLF line endings.

## "No Change" Is Valid

When investigating issues without a specified fix, ASK before coding. Don't go on a "coding spree" - the behavior may be intentional.

## Search Tool Quirks

Some agents' search tools fail silently on single-file paths. If search returns 0 results unexpectedly:

- Try searching a **directory** instead, with a filter for the specific file
- Fall back to terminal `rg` if the native tool misbehaves

## Terminal Search

When native search tools fail or for complex regex searches, use terminal `rg` (ripgrep):

```bash
clear && rg "pattern" path/to/search
```

## Code Generation

- **No Trailing Whitespace**: Never generate lines with trailing spaces or tabs

## Refactoring Standards

- **Property/Field Sync**: When renaming/deleting, search file-wide for ALL references
- **Verify Infrastructure**: Check constructors/fields exist before using them
- **Constructor Fallback**: Use property initializers `{ Prop = value }` if no matching constructor
